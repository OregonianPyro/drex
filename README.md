# Drex
Drex is a dead-simple moderation bot for Discord. It's open-source for those that want to view how it's coded and is not intended to be hosted, although it can be.

> Note: 
Drex is a dead-simple moderation bot coded by Discord user 'Oregonian Pyro#0001'. You can do whatever you please with the code. It *can* be self-hosted if you really desire - but I'm not going to update this code or provide support for it.

The main purpose behind coding Drex was to provide an idea of how someone else does a moderation command, or to inspire and motivate others. It is NOT intended to be used in an actual Discord server, however it can be if you know what you're doing and really have the desire too. I have tested the code and it will run just fine, it's just an ideal bot to be added to a server.
